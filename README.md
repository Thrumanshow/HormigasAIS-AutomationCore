**HormigasAIS AutomationCore** is the core automation engine of the HormigasAIS ecosystem.

It operates as an official **GitHub App**, enabling secure automation, webhook processing, and AI-assisted workflows across repositories and organizations.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

AutomationCore acts as the central nervous system that connects GitHub events with intelligent automation modules.

### Included modules:
- **XOXO** – Internal AI agent for event interpretation and automated responses
- Webhook processors
- Event-driven workflows
- Future automation extensions (LBH, H-AIS)

> XOXO is not a standalone GitHub App.  
> It operates internally within AutomationCore.
